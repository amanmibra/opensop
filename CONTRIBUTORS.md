## Contributing

1. Open an issue first for anything bigger than a small fix, so we can agree on the approach.
2. Set up: install Rust (https://rustup.rs), then `cargo test`.
3. If you change the format (`src/model.rs`), update the schemas in `spec/` and [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) to match.
4. If you change how prompts are built, regenerate the golden output and the example build (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), and review the diffs.
5. Keep examples and fixtures fictional. Never commit real customer names, prompts, or call data.
