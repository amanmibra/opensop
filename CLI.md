# sopc command reference

Every command and flag. `sopc --help` (or `sopc <command> --help`) prints the same information with examples; [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) describes the files sopc reads.

## Install and uninstall

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amanmibra/sopc/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs one `sopc` binary into `~/.local/bin` (macOS, Linux and Windows; amd64 and arm64) and verifies its checksum.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SOPC_REF=v0.0.8` | Install a specific release (default: the latest) |
| `SOPC_INSTALL_DIR=DIR` | Install somewhere other than `~/.local/bin` |

From source, with Rust: `cargo install --git https://github.com/amanmibra/sopc`.

To uninstall, delete the binary: `rm ~/.local/bin/sopc`. If you installed the import skill, also delete `.claude/skills/sopc-import` and `.agents/skills/sopc-import` from your repo.

## How every command works

**The folder.** Every command works on the sopc folder, the one containing `sopc.yaml`: `./sops` if `sops/sopc.yaml` exists, otherwise the current folder if `sopc.yaml` is there. Use `--dir DIR` (short: `-C DIR`) for another folder. It works before or after the command: `sopc --dir path/to/sops validate` and `sopc validate --dir path/to/sops` are the same.

**Output.** Results go to stdout; errors, warnings and progress notes go to stderr, so `--json` and id lists can be piped safely. File paths in messages are relative to the folder you ran sopc from (`sops/procedures/x.md: error [...] line 11: ...`). Color is turned off when output is piped, when `NO_COLOR` is set, or when `TERM=dumb`.

**Exit codes.**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. `sopc lint` exits 0 even when it finds something, because its findings are advisory. |
| `1` | Failure: invalid files, a build that's out of date (`--check`), a failed `compare`, a live prompt that drifted or couldn't be read (`verify`), files left unformatted to keep comments, or a git or file error. |
| `2` | Usage error: an unknown command or flag, a typo (sopc suggests the closest command), or a compile-only flag used with a command. |

A closed pipe (`sopc guide | head`) exits 0.

**Comparing with git.** `plan` and `affected` compare the current files with a git ref and print `Comparing with <ref> (<short sha>)` to stderr. Without `--against`, the ref is your default branch: `origin/HEAD`, then `origin/main`, `main`, `origin/master`, `master`. Git problems are reported in plain words, e.g. ``unknown git ref `origin/release`; check the name, or fetch it (`git fetch origin release`)``.

**Nothing destructive without `--yes`.** Commands that rewrite your files (`fmt`, `convert`) never remove comments silently. A file that would lose comments is left as it is and listed with those comments, and the command exits 1. Rerun with `-y`/`--yes` to allow it. `migrate` rewrites the whole folder, so it only shows its plan until you pass `--yes`.

## sopc

Compiles every agent's prompt into `build/` inside the sopc folder: one `<agent>.prompt.md` per agent, a `<agent>.tool.json` for agents with tool-delivered SOPs, and `lock.json`.

`lock.json` lists, per agent: its `platform_ref`, the prompt's `hash`, the `tools` its SOPs name, and `blocks`: the agent file first, then each block in prompt order, as `{"kind", "id", "hash"}`. `kind` is `agent`, `instruction` or `sop`; a hash is the sha256 of the block's canonical JSON. Groups aren't listed: their blocks are.

```sh
sopc                         # compile ./sops into sops/build
sopc --check                 # exit 1 if sops/build is out of date (for CI)
sopc -C path/to/sops -o out  # compile another folder into out/
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--out DIR` | Write the build somewhere else (default: `DIR/build`) |
| `--check` | Write nothing; exit 1 and show what changed if the build is out of date |
| `--force` | Write into an `--out` folder that has other files but no `lock.json`. Only the files sopc builds are overwritten; nothing is removed |

Builds are written safely: files go to a temporary folder and are renamed into place, and only files the previous build created (as listed in its `lock.json`) are ever removed. Other files in the output folder are left alone. Without `--force`, sopc refuses to write into a non-empty folder it didn't build.

`-o` and `--check` apply only to compiling; `sopc --check validate` is a usage error.

## sopc validate

Finds errors in the files and prints every problem with its file, line (for Markdown SOPs) and a fix. Exits 1 if there are errors; warnings alone exit 0.

```sh
sopc validate
sopc validate --json
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Prints `{"valid": bool, "issues": [{"code", "message", "path", "severity"}]}` to stdout instead, including files that fail to parse. Paths are relative to the sopc folder. |

The error codes are listed in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md#validation).

## sopc lint

Finds duplicated text and conflicting instructions in each agent's compiled prompt: the same sentence twice, the same sentence with different numbers (`10pm` vs `11pm`), "always X" vs "never X", near-identical sentences that have drifted, and variables an agent sets but never uses. The findings are advisory: lint exits 0.

```sh
sopc lint
sopc lint --json
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |

## sopc fmt

Rewrites Markdown SOP files in one canonical style: sections in the standard order (Steps, Never, Warning signs), numbered steps, `-` bullets, one blank line between blocks, and tool markers as `` `tool: name` `` then `` `required` ``. Front matter is kept as written. It never changes a compiled prompt.

```sh
sopc fmt
sopc fmt --check   # for CI
sopc fmt --yaml    # YAML SOPs too
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Write nothing; list files that would change and exit 1 if there are any |
| `--yaml` | Also rewrite YAML SOP files: keys in a fixed order, default settings left out, multi-line text as `\|` blocks. YAML comments below the top of the file can't be kept, so those files need `--yes` |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Allow rewrites that remove comments |

A file that would lose comments is left as it is and listed:

```
sops/procedures/takeout.yaml: not formatted: it would remove 2 comment(s); edit it by hand, or rerun with --yes to remove them
  line 2: # the heading agents see
  line 6: # ask first
```

## sopc plan

Shows which agents a change affects and because of which block, with a diff of each affected prompt. Compares with your default branch unless you pass `--against`.

```sh
sopc plan
sopc plan --summary
sopc plan --against v0.3.0
```

```console
$ sopc plan --summary
Comparing with origin/main (3f9a2c1)
3 agents change:
  instruction `brand-voice` edited → 3 agents: luigis-trattoria, sakura-sushi, tonys-pizza
```

Each line names a block and what happened to it: `edited` (its text or settings changed), `added` or `removed` (an agent started or stopped using it, through its `blocks` or a group). An agent file that changed is listed as `agent file`; a change only `sopc.yaml` explains (a default variable, a group's order, the SOP heading) as `` `sopc.yaml` edited ``.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--against REF` | Compare with this git branch, tag or commit |
| `--summary` | Leave out the diffs |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |

If no default branch can be found, `plan` stops and asks for `--against`. A ref from before `sopc migrate` is built as migrating it would, so the plan right after migrating shows only each agent's own text moving to the top.

## sopc affected

Lists the agents to test for a change: those whose compiled prompt differs from the default branch (or `--against`). Made for CI: run your tests for just these agents. See the [behavior gate example](examples/behavior-gate).

```sh
sopc affected
sopc affected --format platform-ids
sopc affected --ci --all-if-none
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--against REF` | Compare with this git branch, tag or commit |
| `--agents "IDS"` | Select these agents instead (sopc ids or platform ids, separated by spaces or commas). `--against` is ignored |
| `--all-if-none` | Select every agent when nothing else is selected |
| `--format ids\|platform-ids\|json` | `ids`: sopc ids, one per line (default). `platform-ids`: each agent's own id on its platform. `json`: everything, including which SOPs changed for each agent |
| `--ci` | Also write GitHub Actions outputs (`ids`, `platform_ids`, `matrix`, `count`, `all`) and a step summary |

If no default branch can be found, `affected` selects every agent and prints a warning, unless `--agents` or `--all-if-none` was given.

## sopc verify

Checks that what runs in production is what's in git: fetches each agent's live prompt from its platform and compares it with the compiled one. Catches hotfixes made in a platform's dashboard, which the next deploy would silently revert. Run it nightly in CI; see the [drift check example](examples/drift-check).

```sh
sopc verify                 # every agent
sopc verify tonys-pizza     # only these agents
sopc verify --json          # for CI
```

```console
$ sopc verify
Verifying 4 agent(s) against their platforms
luigis-trattoria         elevenlabs  agent_7a1f...                in sync
sakura-sushi             vapi        3f0c2d9e-...                 drifted
tonys-pizza              livekit     tonys-pizza                  skipped: LiveKit: your code loads the prompt; nothing to fetch
pasta-bar                retell      agent_51c9...                error: RETELL_API_KEY is not set (needed to read Retell agents)

--- compiled/sakura-sushi.prompt.md
+++ live/vapi:3f0c2d9e-...
-Sakura is an omakase and sushi counter in Manhattan. Reservations strongly recommended. No delivery.
+Sakura is an omakase and sushi counter in Manhattan. Closed for a private event tonight. No delivery.

1 in sync, 1 drifted, 1 skipped, 1 error
```

| Argument or flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `IDS` | Agents to verify: sopc ids, platform ids or `platform:id` (default: every agent) |
| `--json` | Prints `{"ok", "summary", "agents": [{"id", "platform", "platform_id", "platform_ref", "status", "reason", "diff"}]}` instead |

The prompt is compiled from the current files in memory; `build/` isn't read. Live and compiled prompts must match exactly, except for line endings and whitespace at the very end. A drifted agent shows a diff from the compiled prompt (`-`) to the live one (`+`).

| Status | Meaning | Fails |
|---|---|---|
| `in sync` | The live prompt is the compiled one | |
| `drifted` | They differ; the diff is shown | yes |
| `not comparable` | The agent's prompt is split across nodes (an ElevenLabs workflow with subagent nodes, a Retell LLM with state prompts, a Retell conversation flow) or lives in a custom LLM server | |
| `skipped` | LiveKit agents: the prompt is loaded by your code, so there's nothing to fetch | |
| `error` | A key isn't set, the platform refused it, the agent wasn't found, or the platform couldn't be reached | yes |

Exits 1 if any agent drifted or had an error. Only GET requests are sent; sopc never changes anything on a platform. Requests time out after 20 seconds.

| Variable | Used for |
|---|---|
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs agents: `GET /v1/convai/agents/{id}`, prompt at `conversation_config.agent.prompt.prompt` |
| `VAPI_API_KEY` | Vapi assistants: `GET /assistant/{id}`, the `system` message in `model.messages` |
| `RETELL_API_KEY` | Retell agents: `GET /get-agent/{id}`, then `GET /get-retell-llm/{llm_id}` (the version the agent uses), `general_prompt` |
| `SOPC_ELEVENLABS_URL`, `SOPC_VAPI_URL`, `SOPC_RETELL_URL` | Another base URL for a platform's API, e.g. a proxy or a mock in tests (default: `https://api.elevenlabs.io`, `https://api.vapi.ai`, `https://api.retellai.com`) |

A key only needs read access. Retell returns an agent's latest version, which may be a draft that isn't published yet.

## sopc agents

Lists every agent: its id, platform, platform id and SOPs.

```sh
sopc agents
sopc agents --json   # adds blocks, instructions, tools and prompt hashes
```

With `--json`, each agent has `blocks` (instruction and SOP ids in prompt order, groups expanded), `instructions` and `sops` (the same, by kind), `tools` and `hash`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |

## sopc export

Prints every block as JSON, as sopc read it: for tools built on sopc, such as an editor or a server that shows the files as forms, so they don't need their own parser.

```sh
sopc export
sopc export -C path/to/sops
```

The output is `{"config", "instructions", "sops", "agents"}`. `config` holds `sopc.yaml`'s `variables`, `groups` and `sops_heading`, with defaults filled in. Each instruction, SOP and agent is the canonical JSON its `lock.json` hash is taken over (the fields in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md), with defaults filled in; a step written as plain text stays a string), plus `file`, its path in the folder. Agents also get `platform` and `platform_id`, and every platform field (`livekit`, `vapi`, `elevenlabs`, `retell`), `null` when unset. Variables, groups and `blocks` keep their order in the file.

Only parsing matters here: a file that can't be read prints `{"valid": false, "issues": [...]}`, as `sopc validate --json` does, and exits 1, but references between files (an unknown block, a missing variable) are left to `sopc validate`.

## sopc convert

Rewrites SOPs as Markdown or YAML. Converting never changes a compiled prompt; a file that can't be converted exactly is refused (`convert_failed`), e.g. a YAML goal with line breaks, which a Markdown field can't keep.

```sh
sopc convert --to md                # every YAML SOP
sopc convert --to yaml reservations # one SOP
```

| Argument or flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--to md\|yaml` | The format to write (required) |
| `IDS` | SOP ids to convert (default: every SOP not already in that format) |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Allow conversions that remove comments |

The new file is written before the old one is deleted. Comments at the top of a YAML file become front-matter comments, and back. Converting can change an SOP's hash in `lock.json` when only whitespace differs.

## sopc overlap

For importing existing prompts: shows the text that several prompts share and near-copies that differ only by a value (placeholder candidates, or drift).

```sh
sopc overlap prompts/
```

`PROMPTS` is a folder with one existing prompt per agent, named `<agent-id>.md` or `.txt`.

## sopc compare

For importing existing prompts: checks that each compiled prompt still says everything its original did. Exits 1 if a sentence was lost or changed, and shows the changed words. Sentences that were reworded (for example, one sentence split into steps) are listed but don't fail.

```sh
sopc compare --originals prompts/
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--originals DIR` | Folder with the original prompts, `<agent-id>.md` or `.txt` (required) |

## sopc migrate

Converts a folder written for sopc v0.0.8 or earlier to the current format, in place. In the old format, bases and SOPs chose their agents (`agents`, `exclude`), agents inherited bases (`inherits`) and opted out (`exclude`), and `position` and `sop_order` set the order. Now each agent lists its blocks in order. Other commands fail on an old folder with `old_format` errors that say to run this.

```sh
sopc migrate         # show the plan; write nothing
sopc migrate --yes   # write it
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-y`, `--yes` | Write the changes (without it, only the plan is shown) |

What it does:

- `bases/<id>.md` moves to `instructions/<id>.md`; `agents`, `exclude`, `inherits` and `position` are removed from its front matter (the front matter goes if nothing is left in it).
- SOPs lose `agents` and `exclude`; `sop_order` is removed from `sopc.yaml`.
- Each agent's `instructions` becomes `context`, written right after its platform id, followed by `blocks`: exactly the blocks the old rules gave it, in the order its old prompt had them, one per line. `inherits` and `exclude` are removed. No groups are created; add them afterwards where they help.
- A locked block must now be in every agent. A locked block that some agents didn't get loses its lock, with a warning naming it and those agents.
- Files are edited as text, so comments and layout are kept. Comments directly above a removed field (or on its line) go with it; the plan lists each one.

```console
$ sopc migrate
Migrating sops to the current format (13 file(s) change):
  sops/agents/la-casita.yaml: instructions → context; removed inherits; blocks: restaurant-host, brand-voice-es, allergen-check, delivery-handling, closing
  ...
  sops/bases/brand-voice.md → sops/instructions/brand-voice.md: removed agents, exclude, locked
  ...
warning: `brand-voice` was locked, but not every agent uses it (not: la-casita); a locked block must be in every agent, so its lock is removed
...
Checked: all 4 agent prompt(s) stay the same, except each agent's own text (now `context`) moves to the top.
Nothing written. Rerun with --yes to write these changes.
```

**It checks before and after writing.** Every agent's prompt, `get_sop` payloads and tools are built from the migrated files and compared with what the old rules built: they must be identical, except that the agent's own text moves from after the top bases to the very top of the prompt. Each edited file is also read back to confirm it holds the same values minus the removed fields. If anything differs, nothing is written (`migrate_failed`). With `--yes`, each file is written through a temporary file and renamed into place, old `bases/` files are deleted last, and the check runs again on the files on disk. Then run `sopc` to rebuild `build/`: every hash in `lock.json` changes, because the block formats changed.

A folder that's already partly migrated (it has `instructions/`, or an agent with `blocks` or `context`) is refused; finish it by hand. A folder in the current format prints `already in the current format` and exits 0.

## sopc skills

Installs the `sopc-import` skill, which converts existing prompts into sopc files from inside your coding agent.

```sh
sopc skills install                  # Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode
sopc skills install --agent claude   # one agent
```

| Argument or flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `install` | The only action |
| `--agent claude\|codex\|opencode` | Install for one agent; repeatable. Claude Code reads `.claude/skills`, Codex `.agents/skills`, OpenCode both |
| `--into FOLDER` | Install into another folder |

## sopc guide

Prints the format reference ([FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md)), so it's available offline and matches the installed version.

```sh
sopc guide | less
```
