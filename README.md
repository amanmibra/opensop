# 📋🧩 sopc

**dbt for agent instructions.**

The SOP compiler: modular, git-versioned instructions for teams managing multiple task-driven agents.

Write shared instructions and SOPs once. sopc compiles each agent's full prompt<br>
and shows exactly which agents a change touches.

## Why

An SOP is a standard operating procedure: what an agent should do in a given situation, step by step.

Running one agent per customer usually means dozens of near-identical prompts maintained by hand. A tone tweak means editing all of them. A new rule means remembering which ones need it. Copies drift.

sopc keeps the shared parts in one place, in git, and compiles them into one prompt per agent.

Not related to Mozilla's `sops` (secrets).

## Quickstart

### Already have agent prompts?

Most teams start here: a prompt per agent, written by hand, mostly copied from each other. The `sopc-import` skill converts them for you.

**1. Add the import skill to your repo** (one line, run in the repo root):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amanmibra/sopc/main/skills/sopc-import/SKILL.md --create-dirs -o .claude/skills/sopc-import/SKILL.md
```

For Codex, use `-o .agents/skills/sopc-import/SKILL.md` instead. OpenCode reads either.

**2. Run it in your coding agent:**

| Agent | Run |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/sopc-import` |
| Codex | `$sopc-import` (or pick it from `/skills`) |
| OpenCode | ask it to "use the sopc-import skill" |

The skill installs the `sopc` CLI if it's missing, finds your existing prompts (in code or files, or pulls them read-only from LiveKit, ElevenLabs, Vapi or Retell, helping you set up a key or MCP if needed), turns them into sopc files, checks that nothing was lost, and asks you to approve a one-screen plan before it writes anything.

<details>
<summary>What the import does, step by step</summary>

| Step | Who | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Collect | agent | Copies each existing prompt into `sops/originals/`, asks for anything it can't find |
| Map | `sopc overlap` | Finds text every prompt shares, text some share, and near-copies that differ by a value (or have drifted) |
| Plan | you | Approve a one-screen plan: which instructions, SOPs and groups, how to handle drift |
| Build | agent | Writes the files, keeping the original wording |
| Verify | `sopc compare` | Fails if any original sentence is missing or changed; the agent repeats until it passes |
| Review | `sopc lint` | Flags duplicates and conflicts (10pm vs 11pm, "always X" vs "never X") for you to decide |
| Commit | you | Approve a one-screen summary before anything is committed |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code plugin (shares the skill with your whole team)</summary>

```
/plugin marketplace add amanmibra/sopc
/plugin install sopc@sopc
```

Then run `/sopc:sopc-import` (plugin skills are prefixed with the plugin name). To set it up for everyone who opens the repo, add the marketplace to your project's `.claude/settings.json` under `extraKnownMarketplaces` and enable `sopc@sopc` in `enabledPlugins`; see [Claude Code's plugin docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/marketplace-reference).

### Starting from scratch?

Install the CLI, copy [`examples/livekit-restaurant/sops`](examples/livekit-restaurant/sops) into your repo as `sops/`, and edit it. Every file is commented, and `sopc guide` prints the full format reference. Coding agents can write sopc files from it too.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amanmibra/sopc/main/install.sh | sh
```

One binary for macOS, Linux and Windows. Version pinning, building from source and uninstalling are in the [CLI reference](CLI.md#install-and-uninstall).

### Then: load the compiled prompt in your agent

```ts
const instructions = readFileSync(`sops/build/${agentId}.prompt.md`, "utf8");
```

See the [LiveKit example](examples/livekit-restaurant) for a complete agent.

**Prefer a UI and a database to files in git?** [sopserve](https://github.com/amanmibra/sopserve) runs the same compiler behind forms: compose agents from blocks, review the diff, publish a release, and have each agent fetch its prompt when a call starts.

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/blocks.png" alt="Shared instructions, procedures and groups are written once as blocks; each agent lists the blocks it uses in order, after its own context; sopc compiles one full prompt per agent for LiveKit, Vapi, ElevenLabs or Retell" width="860"></p>

Prompts are compiled from blocks, and each agent lists the blocks it uses:

| | File | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| 🧱 | `instructions/*.md` | shared text: identity, tone, context, policy |
| 📋 | `procedures/*.md` | SOPs: goal, steps, never-do's, warning signs, tools |
| 🎙️ | `agents/*.yaml` | one per agent: platform id, its own text, its blocks in order, values for `{{placeholders}}` |

A block doesn't say who uses it; the agent file does, in prompt order:

```yaml
livekit: tonys-pizza
context: |
  Tony's is a wood-fired pizza shop in Brooklyn. Pickup only after 10pm.
blocks:
  - restaurant-host
  - brand-voice
  - allergen-check
  - closing
variables:
  menu_allergen_link: tonys.com/allergens
```

An SOP reads like a checklist:

```markdown
# Allergen check

**Goal:** Customer leaves knowing whether their order is safe for their allergy.

## Steps
1. Ask if anyone in the order has a food allergy
2. Check each item against {{menu_allergen_link}} `tool: lookup_allergens` `required`

## Never
- Never say an item is "allergen-free" or "safe"
```

- **Groups** in `sopc.yaml` name a set of blocks many agents share; an agent lists the group like a block.
- **The format is checked strictly,** and every mistake is reported with its file and line. See the [SOP rules](FORMAT.md#sop-rules). SOPs can also be written in YAML; `sopc convert` switches between the two.
- Coming from sopc v0.0.8 or earlier? `sopc migrate` converts the folder and checks every prompt stays the same.

Change a shared file and see what moves before you merge:

```console
$ sopc plan
Comparing with origin/main (3f9a2c1)
3 agents change:
  instruction `brand-voice` edited → 3 agents: luigis-trattoria, sakura-sushi, tonys-pizza
  SOP `reservations` edited → 2 agents: luigis-trattoria, sakura-sushi

--- a/sakura-sushi.prompt.md
+++ b/sakura-sushi.prompt.md
-Speak warmly and briefly. Ask one question at a time.
+Speak warmly and briefly. Use the caller's name once you have it. Ask one question at a time.
```

## Usage

Run from your repo. sopc uses the `sops/` folder; add `--dir path/to/sops` to use another.

```sh
sopc              # Compile every agent's prompt into sops/build
sopc validate     # Find errors in the files
sopc lint         # Find duplicated or conflicting instructions
sopc fmt          # Format SOP files
sopc plan         # Show which agents your changes affect, with prompt diffs
sopc affected     # List the agents your changes affect (for CI)
sopc agents       # List every agent with its platform id and SOPs
sopc migrate      # Convert a folder from sopc v0.0.8 or earlier (shows the plan; --yes writes)
sopc verify       # Check live prompts on ElevenLabs, Vapi and Retell match the build
```

Every command and flag is in the [CLI reference](CLI.md), and `sopc <command> --help` shows examples.

### In CI

```sh
sopc --check        # Fail if sops/build is out of date
sopc fmt --check    # Fail if SOP files aren't formatted
sopc validate       # Fail on errors
sopc lint --strict  # Fail on duplicated or conflicting instructions
```

To run your own tests on just the agents a pull request changes, see the [behavior gate](examples/behavior-gate). To block changes that make agents worse with Braintrust evals, see the [Braintrust example](examples/braintrust-evals). To catch prompts edited in a platform's dashboard, run `sopc verify` nightly: see the [drift check](examples/drift-check).

<p align="center"><sub>A bad edit to one shared SOP: <code>sopc plan</code> shows the 4 agents it reaches, and the <a href="examples/braintrust-evals">eval gate</a> blocks the PR with the failing call.</sub></p>

## Working with coding agents

[FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) is the full format reference, written for people and agents, and `sopc guide` prints it. Add this to your project's `AGENTS.md` (Codex, OpenCode) or `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code):

```markdown
Agent instructions live in `sops/` in the sopc format.
Run `sopc guide` and read it before editing anything there.
Finish with `sopc fmt`, `sopc validate`, `sopc lint` and `sopc plan`.
Never pass `--yes` to `sopc fmt`, `sopc convert` or `sopc migrate` unless I've approved what it lists.
```

For editor autocomplete, point `yaml-language-server` at the schemas in [`spec/`](spec).

## Status

Early. sopc is the format and the tools to compile and check it; serving prompts and evaluating calls are left to other tools. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
