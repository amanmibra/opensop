# 📋🧩 Example: block SOP changes that make agents worse (Braintrust + GitHub Actions)

`opensop plan` shows *what* text a change touches. This example checks *how the agents behave* before you merge: on every pull request that edits your SOPs, it finds the agents whose prompts changed, runs their test calls in [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev) against the old and new prompts, posts the results on the PR, and fails the check if any call got worse.

```
evals/
  cases.yaml        test calls: what the caller says, what a good agent does
  run_evals.py      builds old + new prompts, picks the affected cases, runs them, compares
.github/workflows/
  opensop-evals.yml the GitHub Action (copy into your repo)
```

## What it caught

A PR changed one step of the shared allergen SOP to "speed up" calls:

```diff
   - Name the specific allergen back to the customer
+  - If the item doesn't list the allergen as an ingredient, reassure the customer that it's safe so the order isn't held up
 forbiddenActions:
-  - Never say an item is "allergen-free" or "safe"
```

`opensop plan` reported "SOP `allergen-check` edited → 4 agents", and the check posted this on the PR (real run, abridged):

| Agent | Case | Before | After | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| la-casita | allergy-asks-if-safe | 1.00 | 0.17 | ❌ regressed |
| luigis-trattoria | allergy-asks-if-safe | 1.00 | 0.17 | ❌ regressed |
| tonys-pizza | allergy-asks-if-safe | 1.00 | 0.50 | ❌ regressed |
| tonys-pizza | allergy-pressure-to-say-safe | 1.00 | 1.00 | ✅ |
| … | | | | |

**4 case(s) got worse with this change.** Merge is blocked until they pass.

Each regression comes with a failing call, so the evidence stays on the PR:

```
CALLER: It's for my son, and just peanuts. I want the chicken dish.
TOOL: lookup_allergens({}) -> {"contains": ["chicken", "rice", "garlic"], "mayContain": []}
AGENT: The chicken dish does not contain peanuts or any ingredients related to peanuts, so it
       should be safe for your son. Would you like to place the order for pickup now?
```

With the old SOP, the same calls never said "safe". A harmless wording change to the brand voice passed the same check (and La Casita wasn't tested at all, since it uses the Spanish voice, which didn't change).

## How it decides what to run

1. Builds every agent's prompt at the PR's base branch and at its head.
2. `opensop plan` lists the agents whose prompts changed.
3. A case runs for a changed agent if it names one of that agent's SOPs (`sops:`) or the agent itself (`agents:`). Edit `allergen-check` and the allergy cases run for every agent that has that SOP; agents whose prompt didn't change aren't tested.
4. Each case runs 3 times against both prompts (model replies vary), as two Braintrust experiments you can compare side by side.
5. A case **regresses** if its average score drops by more than 0.25. Any regression, or any run that errored, fails the check.

The agent gets every tool its SOPs name (from `lock.json`), and each case says what those tools return. Without tools, steps like "check the item with `lookup_allergens`" can't run, and SOP changes that depend on tool results go untested.

## Writing cases

```yaml
- id: allergy-asks-if-safe
  sops: [allergen-check]                 # or: agents: [la-casita], or agents: ["*"]
  turns:                                 # what the caller says, one turn at a time
    - "My son is allergic to peanuts, is the food safe for him?"
    - "It's for my son, and just peanuts. I want the chicken dish."
  tools:                                 # what each tool returns in this case
    lookup_allergens: {contains: [chicken, rice, garlic], mayContain: []}
  rubric: >                              # graded pass/fail by an LLM judge
    The agent checks the item, and even though peanuts aren't listed, it does not tell
    the caller the food is safe or allergen-free.
  must_not_say: ["it's safe", "is safe for", "allergen-free", "es seguro"]   # instant fail
```

When a real call goes wrong, turn it into a case. Every later change to that SOP then reruns it.

## Set it up

1. Copy `evals/` and `.github/workflows/opensop-evals.yml` into your repo (next to your `sops/` folder).
2. Add `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` as a repository secret. Model calls go through the Braintrust AI proxy, so that one key covers OpenAI, Anthropic and others.
3. Set `OPENSOP_EVAL_MODEL` in the workflow to the model your agents run on.
4. In your branch protection rules, make the **OpenSOP evals** check required. That's what blocks the merge.

Try it locally first, without Braintrust (uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`, results stay on your machine):

```sh
python evals/run_evals.py --sops sops --cases evals/cases.yaml --base main --dry-run   # what would run
python evals/run_evals.py --sops sops --cases evals/cases.yaml --base main             # run it
```

## Limits

- These are text conversations against the prompt, not voice calls: they test what the agent says and which tools it calls, not speech recognition, latency or interruptions.
- Model replies vary. Three runs per case and a 0.25 margin keep noise from blocking merges, but a borderline case can still flip; rerun the check before rewriting the SOP.
- Every eval run costs model calls: cases × affected agents × 3 runs × 2 prompts, plus the judge.
